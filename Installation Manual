Setting Up and Installing the DHT11 Webserver

Devices Needed:
ESP32 Board
DHT11 Sensor
Connection Wires
Laptop
USB Cable
Power Supply (ex. Power Bank)

Instructions:
1. Set Up the ESP32 and DHT11 by connecting them through the use of connection wires.
   Note: The circuit guide will be found on the folder called "Circuit Guide Iot Devices".
2. After setting up the devices use the USB cable to connect the ESP32 board to the laptop.
3. Open the Arduino IDE software and paste the provoded codes.
   Note: The codes is located and can be downloaded to the folder named "ESP32-DHT-Webserver".
4. Edit the *ssid and *password variables with your corresponding wifi credentials so that the ESP32 board can connect to its network.
5. Upload the codes in the ESP32 board memory.
6. Get the IP Address that the serial monitor will provide and paste it on any browser to access the Web Interface.
   Note: Your device should be connected on the same network as where the ESP32 Board is connected.
7. After accessing the IP Address you will now be able to see the calculated data by the DHT11 sensor.
   Note: You can use power bank to maintain the power of the esp32 board.


Setting Up and Installing the Servo Motor Webserver

Devices Needed:
ESP32 Board
Servo Motor
Connection Wires
Laptop
USB Cable
Power Supply (ex. Power Bank)

Instructions:
1. Set Up the ESP32 and servo motor by connecting them through the use of connection wires.
   Note: The circuit guide will be found on the folder called "Circuit Guide Iot Devices".
2. After setting up the devices use the USB cable to connect the ESP32 board to the laptop.
3. Open the Arduino IDE software and paste the provoded codes.
   Note: The codes is located and can be downloaded to the folder named "ESP32 SERVO".
4. Edit the *ssid and *password variables with your corresponding wifi credentials so that the ESP32 board can connect to its network.
5. Upload the codes in the ESP32 board memory.
6. Get the IP Address that the serial monitor will provide and paste it on any browser to access the Web Interface.
   Note: Your device should be connected on the same network as where the ESP32 Board is connected.
7. After accessing the IP Address you will now be able to see the interface and control the servo motor.
   Note: You can use power bank to maintain the power of the esp32 board.
